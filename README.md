## What

Hello world webpack project that works with nodejs and the browser

From https://dev.to/riversun/recipes-on-how-to-create-a-library-that-supports-both-browser-and-node-js-201m#(1)
but it wasn't working for me, so I tweaked some things

## How to use

- clone repository
- `npx webpack`

- `node test.js` to test nodejs
- open "test.html" in your browser to test the browser
